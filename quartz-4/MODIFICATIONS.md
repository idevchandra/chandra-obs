These are the modifications I made

### The Explorer visual changes..

... such as
- bullets for article items
- background color for the selected item




### To remove the Footer from the website
- Open `Footer.tsx`
- Comment or remove the body of the method `const Footer: QuartzComponent = ({ displayClass, cfg }: QuartzComponentProps)`

### To change the bread crumbs arrow
- Open `Breadcrumbs.tsx`
- Change the `spacerSymbol` character
